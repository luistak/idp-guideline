Hi there👋!

This is a guide to think and prepare an individual development plan, based on a few experiences I had in the past years

> Good preparation increases the `probability` of success and decreases the `risk` of things going wrong along the way

## 🚶 Steps

This guideline is totally based on _you_ and is composed by four continuous steps

### 💭 Understanding _your_ current moment

In this step you should start thinking about your current moment, like answering a few questions:

- What are the levels(jr, pl, sr) in my context? (for your manager, tribe and company)

  > You can read this [awesome article](https://www.swyx.io/writing/career-ladders/) about engineering career ladders on [swyx.io](https://www.swyx.io/)

- Where am i?

  > What is my actual level? Junior, Senior, Principal? It depends on your company or the current job position you are looking for

- What is my actual impact sphere? (product, team, tribe, chapter, company, market ...)

  > Understand where you can make the real difference, become noted not only by shining but helping others to do their best it's an awesome way to stand out and develop your peers

- What are my weakness and strengths?
  > Seek out for feedbacks from your peers and managers, also don't limit yourself to a unique perspective of your performance reach out for other managers, coaches and what makes sense at your current moment

### 🚩 Defining goals

Based on your current moment, you should start thinking about your next goals

> Relax this is not an easy thing to do, take a walk, watch some movies, be relaxed to understand what really warms your heart and remember: there is no perfect path, the best path is the one that suits bests for _you_ on _your_ current moment

- Understand future goal, or most close goal to achieve (Ex: become a Sr. Engineer)

  > A common way to think about this is planning 2, 3, and 5 years in the future where you want to be?

- Understand the [persona](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/personas) of your closest goal
  - Responsibilities
  - How this person think
  - Describe every aspect of this person based on a day a day evaluation

### 📈 Defining results and impacts

Based on your closest goal to achieve:

- Think on the results and impacts you want to achieve

  > Instead of what to do, think on what would be notable to represent that you are getting next to your goal or achieving it

- Break it into small deliverables with deadlines

### 📝 Defining actions

Based on every result and impact you want to achieve

- "Brainstorm" your actions, write everything that could come to your mind about future stuffs you could do.
- Understand what you can, could, and don't know how to do
  > Go straight forward looking for answers to understand what you don't know how to do or where to start from.
  > Refining

## ➿ Refinement

After you have finished your first brainstorm following those 4 steps above, you must refine it, thinking what do make sense based on your current context and most close goal following the fluxogram below
